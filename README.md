RFX is a modern, API-compatible drop-in replacement for [re-frame](https://github.com/day8/re-frame), designed for use with React 18+ and **no dependency on Reagent**. Its API is based on hooks.

It integrates seamlessly with vanilla React, popular wrapper libraries like [uix](https://github.com/pitch-io/uix) or even [Reagent](https://github.com/reagent-project/reagent).

**Note:** Documentation is a work in progress!
